#Liddle

Project is still in planning stages.. 

I want to create the 'developers' online editor.. heavy compatibility with common key commands.

My main focus currently is obtaining a list of commands and specifying in detail what they should do in each case. 

If you would like to contribute, feel free to drop me a suggestion in an [Issue](https://github.com/rlemon/Liddle/issues) or just fork / merge the [Notes](https://github.com/rlemon/Liddle/blob/master/Notes.md) file.

Thanks!
